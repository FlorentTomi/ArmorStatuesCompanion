# ArmorStatuesCompanion

A mod companion for the Armor Statues Datapack (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/armor-statues-datapack)

This client-side mod is used alongside the classic *Armor Statues Datapack* and adds a GUI similar to the datapack book, with the same functionalities. 

On server equipped with the datapack, this GUI allows for seamless manipulation of armor stands, without having to go in and out the book.


This is my first mod, I'm open to suggestions via the github bugtracker <3
